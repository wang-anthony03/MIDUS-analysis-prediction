								<p><span><strong>Alternate Title:</strong> MIDUS 3</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>In 1995-1996, the MacArthur Midlife Research Network carried out a national survey of over 7,000 Americans aged 25 to 74 [ICPSR 2760]. The purpose of the study was to investigate the role of behavioral, psychological, and social factors in understanding age-related differences in physical and mental health. The study was innovative for its broad scientific scope, its diverse samples (which included siblings of the main sample respondents and a national sample of twin pairs), and its creative use of in-depth assessments in key areas (e.g. daily diary of stressful experiences [ICPSR 3725] and cognitive functioning [ICPSR 3596]) on a subset of participants. A detailed description of the study and findings generated by it are available at: <a href="http://www.midus.wisc.edu">http://www.midus.wisc.edu</a></p>
<p>With support from the National Institute on Aging, a follow-up of the original Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) sample was conducted in 2004 (MIDUS 2 [ICPSR 4652]). The daily stress and cognitive functioning projects were repeated and expanded at MIDUS 2; in addition the protocol was expanded to include biomarkers and neuroscience.</p>
<p>In 2013 a third wave (MIDUS 3) of survey data was collected on longitudinal participants. Data collection for this follow-up wave largely repeated baseline assessments (e.g., phone interview and extensive self-administered questionnaire), with additional questions in selected areas such as economic recession experiences. Cognitive functioning data were also collected at the same time, while data collection for the daily diary, biomarker, and neuroscience projects commenced in 2017.</p>
<p> MIDUS also maintains a
<a href="http://midus.colectica.org/">Colectica portal</a>, which allows users to interact with variables across waves and create customized subsets. Registration is required.</p></span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Date of Collection:</strong> 2013-05 -- 2014-11</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> <p>The variable M2ID is the linking variable for the four datasets in this collection. The data in this collection can also be linked to all MIDUS datasets using the variable M2ID, including wave 1 [ICPSR 2760] and wave 2 [ICPSR 4652].</p>, <p>Additional information about the Midlife Development in the United States study can be found at the <a href="http://midus.wisc.edu//">MIDUS</a> Web site.</p>, <p>The title of this study was changed from National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS 3), 2013-2014, to Midlife in the United States (MIDUS 3), 2013-2014, on May 9, 2017.</p></span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> Only living respondents who completed the M2 phone interview were eligible for participation in the M3 survey.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Longitudinal</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> The noninstitutionalized, English-speaking population of the United States.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> individual, household</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), cognitive assessment test, mail questionnaire</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Description of Variables:</strong> <p>The Aggregate Data dataset contains 2,613 variables and 3,294 cases. This dataset includes information about the following types of variables: recession experience, health, education, occupation, marital status, household roster, children, caregiving, living arrangements, race and ethnicity, life satisfaction, health insurance, personal beliefs, finances, community involvement, neighborhood, social networks, sexuality, religion and spirituality, discrimination, childhood family background, images of life change, and psychological turning points.</p>
<p>The Disposition Codes dataset contains 6 variables and 7,108 cases. This dataset contains final disposition codes for the M3 phone interview.</p>
<p>The Coded Text Data dataset contains 183 variables and 3,137 cases. This dataset contains coded text responses to open-ended questions and those which had "Other-specify" responses.</p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> 77 percent of living longitudinal participants completed the M3 phone survey. Details of fielding and final disposition codes for Phone, SAQ, as well as Cognitive data collection projects can be found in the Field Report.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Presence of Common Scales:</strong> For information regarding scales, please refer to the Psychosocial Constructs and Composite Variables.</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Original Release Date:</strong> 2015-12-18</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Version History:</strong> 2019-04-30 <p>This collection has been updated to include new data supplied by the P.I.  The resupplied data includes new cases for the Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQ) as part of the MIDUS M3 re-fielding effort undertaken to increase participant completion during 2015 fielding.  The re-fielding cases can be identified and/or filtered with C1STATUS or the new M3RE_FILTER variables. Ten post-stratification weight variables (C1PWGHT1 through C1PWGHT10), and a new occupation variable based on Standard Occupation Classification system, have been added to the Aggregate dataset. Documentation has been updated accordingly.  For more detailed information, please refer to the P.I.'s README file.</p>
<p>The Mortality dataset has been removed from this collection and is a separate study, Midlife in the United States (MIDUS3): Mortality Data, 2016 (ICPSR 37237). </p>
<p>The datasets have been renumbered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dataset 1: Aggregate Data</li>
<li>Dataset 2: Disposition Codes</li>
<li>Dataset 3: Coded Text Data</li>
