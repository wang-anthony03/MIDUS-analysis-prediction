# MIDUS-analysis-prediction
Jupyter Notebook analyzing medical data from MIDUS set, using it to predict conditions in 10 years based off current health

I created this project during my junior year summer and senior year fall of high school. I used the MIDUS dataset, found here: https://midus.wisc.edu/ 
I used stata in jupyter notebook to analyze the data, then organized it on different scales for different responses.
I took data 10 years apart, and used the data from a year to predict the data from 10 years later, using elastic net regularization and logistic regression.
