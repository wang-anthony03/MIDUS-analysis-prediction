		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>In 1995-1996, the MacArthur Midlife Research Network
carried out a national survey of 7,108 Americans aged 25 to 74
(MIDLIFE IN THE UNITED STATES (MIDUS),
1995-1996 [ICPSR 2760]). The purpose of the study was to investigate
the role of behavioral, psychological, and social factors in
understanding age-related differences in physical and mental
health. The study was innovative for its broad scientific scope, its
diverse samples (which included twins and the siblings of main sample
respondents), and its creative use of in-depth assessments in key
areas (e.g., daily stress and cognitive functioning). A description of
the study and findings from it are available at
<a href="http://www.midus.wisc.edu">http://www.midus.wisc.edu</a>. With support from the National Institute on Aging, a longitudinal follow-up of the original MIDUS samples: core sample (N = 3,487), metropolitan over-samples (N = 757), twins (N = 925 complete pairs), and siblings (N = 950), was conducted in 2004-2006. Guiding hypotheses for it, at the most
general level, were that behavioral and psychosocial factors are
consequential for physical and mental health. MIDUS II respondents were
aged 35 to 86. Data collection largely repeated baseline assessments
(e.g., phone interview and extensive self-administered questionnaire),
with additional questions in selected areas (e.g., cognitive
functioning, optimism and coping, stressful life events, and
caregiving). To add refinements to MIDUS II, an African American sample
(N = 592) was recruited from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who participated in
a personal interview and completed a questionnaire paralleling the
above assessments. Also administered was a modified form of the mail
questionnaire, via telephone, to respondents who did not complete a
self-administered questionnaire.</p></span></p>

These original files do not reflect any of the processing done by ICPSR., The online analysis (SDA) file is a merged file comprised of the four datasets within this data collection. The files were merged using the variable M2ID. Users of this merged file should review the information in the "Documentation of Post-stratification Weights Created at MIDUS II," available through the ICPSR and NACDA Web sites, prior to analysis., A document pertaining to the naming conventions for this study has been added to the collection., The title of this study was changed from National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS II), 2004-2006, to Midlife in the United States (MIDUS 2), 2004-2006, on May 9, 2017., <p>Additional information about the Midlife Development in the United States study can be found at the

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> The respondents to this study were first interviewed as part of the NATIONAL SURVEY OF MIDLIFE DEVELOPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES (MIDUS), 1995-1996 (ICPSR 2760). MIDUS was based on a nationally representative random-digit-dial (RDD) sample of noninstitutionalized, English-speaking adults, aged 25 to 74, selected from working telephone banks in the coterminous United States. Predesignated households were selected in random replicates, one-fourth of which included a special nonrespondent incentive
component. Contact persons were informed that the survey was being carried out through the Harvard Medical School and that it was designed to study health and well-being during the middle years of life. After explaining the study to the informant, a household listing was generated of people in the age range of 25 to 74, and a random respondent was selected. Oversampling of older people and men was achieved by varying the probability of carrying out the interview at this stage as a joint function of the age and sex of the randomly selected respondent. No other person in the household was selected if the respondent did not complete the interview. There was no additional
sampling of cases for the longitudinal component of MIDUS II -- it was a follow-up study and attempted to recontact original MIDUS participants. More information about the MIDUS II sample can be found in the document "Descriptions of MIDUS Samples," available for download through the ICPSR and NACDA Web sites.</span></p>
